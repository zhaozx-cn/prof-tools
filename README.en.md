# vllm-ascend-workspace

**[中文](README.md)** | **English**

A composable local development scaffold for working on [vLLM](https://github.com/vllm-project/vllm) and [vLLM Ascend Plugin](https://github.com/vllm-project/vllm-ascend) in a single workspace, with built-in AI Agent skills for automated environment setup, remote NPU machine management, and code synchronization.

## What problem does this solve

Developing vLLM Ascend typically involves editing code locally, running tests on remote Ascend NPU servers, and tracking upstream vLLM changes — all of which require repetitive Git, SSH, and environment configuration.

`vllm-ascend-workspace` wraps these operations into a set of AI Agent skills. You can ask an Agent to handle them in natural language, or ignore the skills entirely and use it as a plain multi-repo workspace.

## Quick start

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/maoxx241/vllm-ascend-workspace.git
cd vllm-ascend-workspace

# Initialize submodules
git submodule update --init --recursive
```

If you use an Agent-capable IDE (Cursor, Windsurf, etc.) or terminal tool (Claude Code, Codex CLI, etc.), you can complete the rest of the setup in natural language:

> "Initialize this workspace and set me up for vLLM Ascend development."

The Agent will detect your environment, install required tools, and configure Git remotes and forks.

## Built-in skills


| Skill                  | Purpose                                                                                      | When to use                                                |
| ---------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------- |
| **repo-init**          | Install GitHub CLI, authenticate, initialize submodules, configure forks and remote topology | After first clone                                          |
| **machine-management** | Add, verify, repair, or remove a remote Ascend NPU server and its managed container          | When setting up a remote NPU dev machine                   |
| **session-management** | Create, inspect, and clean isolated sessions: local worktree, remote container, state namespace, and resource leases | For parallel remote work or multiple agents |
| **remote-toolbox**    | Structured target/probe/exec/job/sync/service/artifact/cleanup tools for remote containers | When agents need local-tool-like control of a remote session container |
| **remote-code-parity** | Sync the full local workspace state (including uncommitted changes) to a remote container    | Triggered automatically before remote test or service runs |
| **modelscope**       | Download, resume, status-check, and SHA256-verify ModelScope model weights                  | When model weights need to be downloaded into an explicit local directory |
| **vllm-ascend-serving** | Launch a vLLM Ascend inference service on a remote container, with NPU probing, auto card selection, and incremental restart | When you need an inference service on a remote machine |
| **vllm-ascend-benchmark** | Run `vllm bench serve` performance benchmarks on a remote container, with multi-run warmup and statistical aggregation | When you need throughput/latency benchmarks or performance regression checks |
| **ascend-memory-profiling** | Profile and attribute HBM memory usage on Ascend NPU, with per-component breakdown and evidence chains | When you need to analyze memory consumption of a vLLM serving workload |
| **ascend-profiling-collection** | Collect Ascend torch-profiler data: start service, bracket profile window, run workload, remote analyse, and write a manifest | When you need kernel_details/trace_view captures |
| **ascend-profiling-analysis** | Analyze collected profiler roots/manifests and generate step/layer/operator/cross-rank reports | When you need to analyze profiling output |


All skills are **optional**. Use any subset, or none at all.

## Usage examples

When talking to an Agent:

```
# Initialization
"Help me initialize this repo"
"Help me set up this repo"

# Machine management
"Add these two servers, IPs are x.x.x.1 and x.x.x.2, password is xxxx"
"Set up this server for me, IP is x.x.x.x, password is xxxx"
"Remove the x.x.x.x server"

# Code sync
"Sync my code to the server and rebuild"

# Model weight download
"Download Qwen/Qwen3-32B from ModelScope to /root/Qwen/Qwen3-32B and show progress"
"Verify the ModelScope weights under /root/Qwen/Qwen3-32B"

# Serving (--model must point to weights already present on the remote container)
"Launch a 4-card inference service on x.x.x.x using /home/weights/Qwen3-32B-W8A8 with W8A8 quantization"
"Check the service status on x.x.x.x"
"Stop the service on x.x.x.x"

# Benchmarking
"Run a benchmark on x.x.x.x with Qwen3.5-35B, 4 cards, 5 runs keep last 4"
"Compare throughput between main and this PR"
```

## Design principles

- **Nothing is mandatory** — All skills are optional. Developers choose what to use.
- **Local state stays untracked** — User-specific remotes, auth, and machine config live only in the untracked `.vaws-local/` directory.
- **Parallel tasks stay isolated** — Remote parallel work should use sessions: each task gets its own local worktree, remote container, state namespace, and resource leases.
- **Remote operations are structured** — Agents should prefer the remote toolbox for JSON results, observable logs, resumable artifact manifests, and cleanup-capable state.
- **Submodules point to community** — `.gitmodules` always targets `vllm-project` official repos. Personal forks are a local runtime concern.
- **Agent-driven, not Agent-dependent** — Everything can be done manually. Agent skills just make it more convenient.

## Recommended remote topology

Skills recommend the following topology, but never enforce it:


| Repository    | `origin`             | `upstream`                       |
| ------------- | -------------------- | -------------------------------- |
| workspace     | Your fork (optional) | `maoxx241/vllm-ascend-workspace` |
| `vllm`        | Your fork (optional) | `vllm-project/vllm`              |
| `vllm-ascend` | Your fork            | `vllm-project/vllm-ascend`       |
