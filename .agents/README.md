# Repo-local skills

This directory contains the repository-local skill layer for Codex, Claude Code, and similar agents.

Remote development now has a substrate layer at `.remote-dev/`. Use native local
tools for local work, and use `.remote-dev` companion tools for remote endpoint
work:

- `remote.read`
- `remote.write`
- `remote.edit`
- `remote.multi_edit`
- `remote.bash`
- `remote.glob`
- `remote.grep`
- `remote.ls`
- `remote.monitor`
- `remote.apply_patch`

The `.agents` skills remain the domain workflow layer. They should consume the
remote-dev substrate and keep the older VAWS remote-toolbox wrappers as
compatibility backend for managed sessions, sync, service adapters, and cleanup.

## Layout

- `.agents/skills/repo-init/` is the source-of-truth skill package for repository initialization.
- `.agents/skills/machine-management/` is the source-of-truth skill package for remote machine attach, verify, repair, and removal workflows.
- `.agents/skills/session-management/` is the source-of-truth skill package for isolated parallel agent sessions.
- `.agents/skills/remote-toolbox/` is the compatibility skill package for managed VAWS target/probe/exec/job/sync/service/artifact/cleanup tools.
- `.agents/skills/remote-code-parity/` is the source-of-truth skill package for remote code parity before remote execution.
- `.agents/skills/modelscope/` is the source-of-truth skill package for ModelScope weight download, resume, status, and SHA256 verification workflows.
- `.agents/skills/vllm-ascend-serving/` is the source-of-truth skill package for starting, checking, and stopping vLLM Ascend online services on managed containers.
- `.agents/skills/vllm-ascend-benchmark/` is the source-of-truth skill package for running `vllm bench serve` performance benchmarks on managed containers.
- `.agents/skills/ascend-memory-profiling/` is the source-of-truth skill package for profiling and attributing HBM memory usage on Ascend NPU for vLLM serving scenarios.
- `.agents/skills/ascend-profiling-collection/` is the source-of-truth skill package for collecting Ascend torch-profiler traces and verified manifests.
- `.agents/skills/ascend-profiling-analysis/` is the source-of-truth skill package for analyzing collected profiler roots/manifests and generating reports.
- `.agents/scripts/workspace_profile.py` is the shared low-level helper for the local workspace machine profile.
- `.agents/lib/vaws_local_state.py` is the shared library for untracked local runtime state.
- `.agents/lib/vaws_session_id.py` and `.agents/lib/vaws_session_state.py` are the shared libraries for session identity, state, locks, and leases.

- `.agents/lib/vaws_validate.py` is the shared validation library for agent-facing ids, environment names, path boundaries, and NPU device lists.
- `AGENTS.md` carries repository-wide routing rules and mandatory decision gates.

## Script-first convention

When a workflow has deterministic shell, SSH, Git, or local-state mechanics, prefer the helper script instead of rebuilding the command inline in the conversation.

Wrapper-style helpers should stream bounded phase progress on `stderr` and keep one final machine-readable JSON payload on `stdout`.

For machine-management specifically, image selection is an explicit user decision gate: choose `rc`, `main`, `stable`, or a concrete custom image reference. `rc` is the recommended developer track. Do not silently fall back to `auto`, `latest`, or another moving tag.

When you add or revise a helper script, keep the CLI alias-tolerant and give safe defaults for metadata that can be inferred. The goal is to reduce agent parameter brittleness, not to force one exact flag spelling.

Current primary helpers:

- `repo-init/scripts/repo_init_probe.py`

Low-level machine-management helpers remain available for implementation work and debugging:

- `machine-management/scripts/inventory.py`
- `machine-management/scripts/manage_machine.py`

Reference files under `references/` are fallback detail, not the default execution path.

## Local runtime state

Untracked workspace-local state lives under `.vaws-local/`:

- `.vaws-local/machine-profile.json`
- `.vaws-local/machine-inventory.json`
- `.vaws-local/remote-code-parity/install-consents.json`
- `.vaws-local/remote-code-parity/runtime-state.json`
- `.vaws-local/serving/<machine-alias>.json`
- `.vaws-local/remote-toolbox/logs/`
- `.vaws-local/remote-toolbox/jobs/`
- `.vaws-local/remote-toolbox/artifacts/`
- `.vaws-local/sessions/<session-id>/session.json`
- `.vaws-local/sessions/<session-id>/serving.json`
- `.vaws-local/sessions/leases.json`
- `.vaws-local/benchmark/`
- `.vaws-local/memory-profiling/`
- `.vaws-local/ascend-profiling-collection/runs/`
- `.vaws-local/profiling-analysis/runs/`

Parallel remote work should use `session-management` first. A session owns a local worktree, a dedicated remote container, session-scoped serving/benchmark/profiling state, and resource leases. Existing `--machine` commands remain legacy-compatible for single-tenant workflows.

The remote-dev substrate is the preferred agent-facing surface once an endpoint
exists. It resolves host/port direct endpoints by default, mirrors native
read/edit/bash/search/patch semantics, records local refs under
`.remote-dev/state/`, and exposes an MCP server plus CLI fallbacks.

The remote toolbox remains the managed VAWS backend. It resolves host and
container endpoints, probes actual runtime facts, runs bounded remote shell
commands with local logs, tracks long jobs, splits source-only/materialize/install
sync modes, wraps service lifecycle entrypoints, transfers artifacts with SSH
streaming plus hash manifests, and performs dry-run-capable cleanup.

Remote-code-parity transport is container-only after machine attach: use machine inventory to resolve the target, then push synthetic refs directly into the container-local cache root. Synthetic mirrors should also publish an advertised branch ref for the current snapshot so nested repos can be materialized without brittle submodule fetch behavior. Runtime installs should explicitly forward whitelisted `VAWS_*` compile/cache env into the remote shell, configure multiple pip indexes (Tsinghua as primary, Aliyun and PyPI as additional), scope the default Ascend package index to `vllm-ascend` installs, reuse pip / uv / CMake `FetchContent` caches under `/root/.cache`, default paired-image editable installs to `--no-deps`, bound uv bootstrap mirror attempts, stream progress for long package steps, record the effective install env, and keep consent/runtime-state writes atomic.

The legacy repo-root `.machine-inventory.json` is compatibility input only and should not be reintroduced as the primary path.

Key guardrail:

- on a missing machine profile, `workspace_profile.py ensure` now requires either `--username` or `--generate`
- broad init should normally go through `repo-init/scripts/repo_init_profile.py`, which narrows the machine-username choice to: detected Git username, random `agent#####`, or custom
- this prevents silent default usernames during broad init or first machine attach

## Cursor IDE integration

Cursor IDE users: see `.cursor/rules/` for IDE-specific glob-activated rules that complement `AGENTS.md`. These rules are a thin pointer layer — they do not duplicate skill or routing content, and are designed to remain stable across submodule version switches.
